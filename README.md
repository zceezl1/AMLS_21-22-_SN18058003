Final assignment 2021-2022

The naming of the file follows the following structure:
feature + classifier + binary/multiclass.py
so if algorithm with 'HOG feature binary classified with KNN' is required, go to 'HOG_KNN_b.py'

'KNN_b' and 'KNN_m' are algorithms without HOG feature, which are KNN binary classification and KNN multiclass classification respectively.

all files can be run independently

dataset folder should be placed at the root of the project
